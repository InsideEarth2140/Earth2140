1. Right click on the game in the Steam Library
2. Select last entry "Properties"
3. In the "General" tab (the first one that is displayed) click on the first button "Set start options"
4. Copy the following string: "-KR -MD -MS -MW -WW"
5. Now all cheats should work as usual with Shift+Command* - if you type in, just re-type! ;-)
